# 📝 React Memo App

A minimal and functional note-taking application built with **React.js**. This project allows users to add, view, and delete notes — similar to Google Keep — using a clean, component-based structure.

- `Header` – Displays the top bar title.
- `Footer` – Footer at the bottom of the page.
- `CreateArea` – Input form for new notes.
- `Note` – Renders individual notes with delete functionality.
- `App` – Main component that manages state and logic.
